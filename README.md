# React Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built using React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add new todos and mark them as complete. The project makes use of React hooks like `useState` and `useContext` to manage and update application state efficiently. Users can type a task into an input field and add it to a list. Each todo can be marked as completed, which toggles its completion status visually and in the internal state.

The app structure is modular, with components such as `TodoForm`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoContext`, making it easy to scale and maintain. The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive look.

This project was created by following the **Chai aur React** tutorial series on the YouTube channel **Chai Aur Code**, which provides a beginner-friendly walkthrough of core React concepts and project-building techniques.

To run the app locally, clone the repository, install dependencies using `npm install`, and start the development server with `npm run dev`.
