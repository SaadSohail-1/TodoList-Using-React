# React Todo App

This is a simple and functional Todo application built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and even edit existing tasks. The app also uses the browser's local storage to persist data, ensuring that your todos remain saved even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

State is managed using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, and the overall logic is organized using React Context to keep the code clean and maintainable. Features like editing and saving todos make this a great foundational project for learning Reactâ€™s component structure, state management, and local storage integration.

This project was created by following the **Chai aur React** tutorial series by the **Chai Aur Code** YouTube channel, which provides an excellent step-by-step guide for beginners building React projects.
